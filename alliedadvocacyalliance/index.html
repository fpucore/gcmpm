			<div style="font-size:80%"><strong>An umbrella body, representing global independent publishing.</strong></div><br>
			<br>	
			<p><div style="font-size:70%">We are an alliance for independent publishing and journalism, run by active 
			industry participants.<br>
			<br>
			Founded in the first quarter of 2020 and based in Stockholm, Sweden, we remained largely inactive until 2022.<br>
			<br>
			The alliance was established through a united effort to advocate for freedom of the press, with a focus on 
			supporting independent publishing and journalism.<br>
			<br>
			Defining "publishing" and "journalism" is an ongoing challenge amplified at a time where misinformation and 
			mistruths are increasingly common.<br>
			<br>
			Defining what is established as "independent" is equally challenging as there are many platforms available 
			which enable anyone to establish publishing operations, literally overnight.<br>
			<br>
			Active participants which make up the alliance understand all aspects of the industry well, particularly that of 
			independent publishing.<br>
			<br>
			We believe independent publishing is increasingly becoming more critical to a healthy media industry.<br>
			<br>
			It is independent journalism which is often highly influential in shaping the world's news and current affairs.<br>
			<br>
			The alliance offers a professional, united voice which serves as an umbrella body to represent independent 
			publishers and journalists.<br>
			<br>
			We aim not to take away the power of the independent voice, but strengthen it through unity.<br>
