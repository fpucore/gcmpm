<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%"><b>Forward Thinking Australia</b> was established late November 2018 as a division of Freedom Publishers 
	Union.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">We lobby primarily for political policies through operations supporting political parties of which we believe can 
	deliver the best policy outcomes for the Australian Federation and Queensland State.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">We are party-neutral and are proud of our political independence and free-thought philosophy. We firmly believe in 
	the democratic processes and trust they will ultimately deliver fair policies which benefit all citizens.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">Any support we offer a political party only comes after we have assessed the policies of the party and are satisfied 
	they are aligned with the political values of Forward Thinking Australia.</div></font><F3>
<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">The evolving operations model we have adopted is constantly assessed and enhanced. This allows us to adapt to the 
	shifting dynamics of the Australian political environment. These dynamics may sometimes shift the scope or focus of our operations. This shift is entirely 
	organic.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">Any support we offer should not be considered a permanent endorsement of the political party.</div></font>

<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">We do not discriminate against any political party, individual politician or other official political representative, 
	with the exception of specific cases that we have concluded expressions of political values of a party or an individual are unfair, offensive, contrary to the general values of 
	democracy, or outright extreme and dangerous - Category 3.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">Forward Thinking Australia will not support the policies from any political party or individual in 
	Category 3, as we have concluded their expressions of political values are unfair, offensive, contrary to the general values of democracy, or outright extreme and 
	dangerous.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">We reserve the right to express disagreement with the views, opinions and/or policies of a political party, 
	individual politician or other official political representative. We will always endeavor to engage, debate and compromise, where necessary, to encourage improvement of 
	alternate policies which we believe have the potential to be adapted to become more appropriately aligned with the political values of Forward Thinking Australia.</div></font>

	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%"><i>Freedom from COVID Alarmism</i></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">The Government's response to the global pandemic is driven by a narrative of fear. The response has been entirely 
	disproportionate to the actual associated health risks. Any pursuit of "COVID Zero" is absurd and should be abandoned. The only sustainable solution is for Australians to learn 
	to live with COVID-19 in the same way we live with other transmissible viruses.</div></font>

	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%"><i>Free Speech</i></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">Free speech is a critical pillar of democracy. Continued attacks on free speech only accelerate its erosion in 
	Australia. This erosion of free speech is harming democracy, impeding the ability for free expression and is increasing censorship of opposing voices.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">Sub-determination of party of influence: Liberal Democrats</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%"><i>Freedom from Surveillance</i></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">Increased domestic mass-surveillance is disproportionate to the risk of domestic terrorism. Ever-expanding 
	surveillance laws have allowed for a domestic security environment which is increasingly free-for-all, in too many cases enabling warrantless access to data and networks. 
	Mass-surveillance and dragnet surveillance laws are not justified, rushed through Parliament without appropriate scrutiny and operate with insufficient oversight.</div></font>

<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%"><i>Support to Liberal Democrats - Freedom from COVID Alarmism</i></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">We believe in a commitment which would rule out future lockdowns. We believe that lawful protests should be permitted 
	without unnecessary law enforcement interference or intervention. Vaccines must remain available to all Australians, on a voluntary basis. Vaccine mandates should not be permitted 
	and should be outlawed by the Federal Government. We believe QR codes should be removed as they are too easily abused and personal data too easily accessed by unauthorized 
	parties. Most importantly, we must return to governing under common law and not under public health directives or emergency biosecurity powers.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%"><i>Support to Liberal Democrats - Free Speech</i></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">Without constitutional protection for free speech Australians remain at great risk of losing a critical pillar of 
	democracy. We believe that free speech could be better protected through constitutional amendment. Protections for free speech must be expanded to better protect against internet 
	censorship. We must foster a free and open internet where creativity can flourish without unnecessary control, intervention and website blocking.</div></font>
<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%"><i>Support to Liberal Democrats - Freedom from Surveillance</i></div></font>
<br>
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">We must resist government encroachment into the digital space by opposing digital identities. We must abolish all 
	mass-surveillance laws which enable the domestic security apparatus to engage in unjustified domestic spying on innocent citizens. We must stop the dragnet collection of metadata. 
	We must stop all attacks on encryption by the Government through its attempts of forcing backdoors into product and software design. All attempts to weaken encryption and computer 
	security must cease. Encryption is NOT a crime!</div></font>
